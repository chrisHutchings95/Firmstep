# Firmstep
Developer Test

My chosen solution was to use my knowledge of PHP and JavaScript to create an application similar to the one shown in the example. I used PHPMyAdmin for the database system to store the customers information so that you could see who was next in the queue and the service they wanted as well as their name. The database username and password is included in the firmstep.php file and the insert.php file.
I was using XAMPP to run and test my solution locally, localhost/firmstep/login.php, on the login page you have a customer button and an admin button. You can just click on Admin button and it will let you onto the main page of the solution which is the ability to add customers and see their position in the queue. If you click the customer button you will be able to see the position of the customers in the queue.
I decided to use some Bootstrap for the css to make it look a bit more appealing. I used bootstrap on the buttons and the tables.
